# 30-Or-Bust
Computer Science I focused on the language Java, creating 30 or Bust. The purpose is to roll a dice, getting two random integer values, and one of the sum. User chooses either, and if the score exceeds 30, user points reset. Implemented the use of Arrays, Methods, Classes, and Constructors.
